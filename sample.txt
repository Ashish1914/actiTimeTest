This is what i am changin again!!

This is just to test that $ vim/vi and touch cmd

1. Edit new/existing file:

$ vi <file name> - will open file 

If this is a new file, it'll be empty when you open it, and you can start adding content. If this is an existing file, you'll see its contents, which you can now edit..

vi tip: Press "i" to enter "insert mode" so you can type and copy/paste. Use the arrow keys to move back and forth in the file. Press "Esc" to exit "insert mode" when you are done modifying the file. Type ":wq" to save and quit.

2.  Create an empty file (which you can later open for editing):
$ touch <newfile.txt>
